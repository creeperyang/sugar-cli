> Simple yet powerful tool for prototyping development

`sugar-cli` is a tool to help build prototypes.

When we write web pages to prototype our interaction and visual design, pure static html is sometimes not powerful enough. And pages written in `PHP/JSP/...` have too many dependencies to work correctly. So, this is why `sugar-cli` appeared, and it provides powerful capabilities with simple syntax.
