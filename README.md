# sugar-cli

> Cli for prototyping development

`sugar-cli` is a tool to help you build prototypes.

When we write web pages to prototype our interaction and visual design, pure static html is sometimes not powerful enough. And pages written in `PHP/JSP/...` have too many dependencies to work correctly. So, this is why `sugar-cli` appeared, and it provides powerful capabilities with simple syntax.

## Install

```bash
# need run with the security privileges
sudo npm i -g sugar-cli
```

## Usage

Just run `sugar help` for all info.

1. `sugar init` will init the dir structure and a simple demo. So you can quickly start.
2. `sugar start` will run a dev server, and you can view pages in browser.
3. `sugar build` will build all templates to static htmls.
